## Saleor Provider

**Demo:** TBD

Before getting starter, a [Saleor](https://saleor.io/) account and store is required before using the provider.

Next, copy the `.env.template` file in this directory to `.env.local` in the main directory (which will be ignored by Git):

```bash
cp framework/saleor/.env.template .env.local
```

Then, set the environment variables in `.env.local` to match the ones from your store.
